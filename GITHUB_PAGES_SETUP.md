# GitHub Pages Configuration Guide

## ðŸš¨ **The Issue**

Your Spotify clone is showing a blank page because GitHub Pages is serving the **development version** instead of the **built version**.

## âœ… **The Solution**

You need to configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `gh-pages` branch instead of the `main` branch.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Hello-India/MusicF/settings

2. **Navigate to Pages section:**
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages"

3. **Change the source:**
   - Under "Source", change from "Deploy from a branch" to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch
   - Click "Save"

4. **Wait for deployment:**
   - It may take 2-5 minutes for the changes to take effect
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's deployed

### **What's Happening:**

- **Current Issue:** GitHub Pages is serving `/src/main.tsx` (development version)
- **After Fix:** GitHub Pages will serve the built files from `gh-pages` branch
- **Result:** Your Spotify clone will display properly

### **Expected Result:**

After configuring GitHub Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch, you should see:
- âœ… Dark Spotify theme
- âœ… Sidebar navigation
- âœ… Main content with playlists
- âœ… Player controls
- âœ… Responsive design

### **Test the Fix:**

Once you've changed the GitHub Pages source:
1. Wait 2-5 minutes
2. Visit: https://hello-india.github.io/MusicF/
3. You should see the full Spotify clone interface

### **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Clear browser cache** and refresh
2. **Check the Actions tab** to see if there are any deployment errors
3. **Wait longer** - sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes

The built files are already in the `gh-pages` branch, so once you configure GitHub Pages correctly, it should work immediately! ðŸŽ‰
